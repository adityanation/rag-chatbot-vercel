# RAG Chatbot

## Overview
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that provides intelligent responses by retrieving relevant data from the web and generating responses based on the retrieved content. The chatbot is deployed as a web application for public access.
## Features
- Web scraping for real-time data retrieval
- Intelligent response generation using a retrieval-augmented approach
- Web-based user interface for interaction
- Online deployment for public usage
## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Gradio (for user interface)
- **Backend**: Flask or FastAPI (for API handling)
- **Machine Learning**: Transformer-based models (Hugging Face models or alternatives)
- **Web Scraping**: Selenium (as BeautifulSoup is not used)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages, Streamlit Sharing, or another hosting service

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install flask gradio selenium transformers torch requests
  ```

### Running the Chatbot Locally

2. Start the web scraper (if applicable):
   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```
3. Run the chatbot application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open the application in your browser (Gradio will provide a local link).

## Deployment
To deploy the chatbot online:
1. Set up a cloud server or use a platform like Hugging Face Spaces or Render.
2. Configure environment variables if needed.
3. Deploy the `app.py` file with the necessary dependencies.

## Usage
